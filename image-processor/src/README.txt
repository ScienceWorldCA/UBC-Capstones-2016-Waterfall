This is a README file for image conversion program.

Image conversion program takes an imput image with any formats that java supports(e.g. jpeg, png, bmp) and converts it to binary stream. The JAVA file is the source code of the program.

There is also a JAR file that allow user to use the code without modifying the source code through a simple UI. Once open the JAR file, it will allow user to choose an input image from the computer, then ask the number of valves needed, and finally convert the image to binary stream and save it back to the same folder as the input image.

Notes: When choosing the input image, because detailed images are hard to shown with limited number of water streams, simple images with strong contrast between color of pattern and background are preferred.
